## Description   
We delineate the borders of masses (cancer) in breasts using different supervised and unsupervised learning methods and a statistical method as well, we showcase them using a website built with Django.

## Notebooks Showing the work

The Jupiter Notebook [Creating Metadata](https://github.com/ynes99/mammogram_segmentation/blob/master/managing%20the%20data.ipynb) facilitates the use of data in this project by creating metadata.
